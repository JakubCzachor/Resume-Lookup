# Resume-Lookup
Resume Parser built with a MERN stack using various frameworks. 
Parses the text automatically and uploads the keywords to a MongoDB database for lookup later, and keeps a file of the uploaded resume hosted locally.

Instructions:

Replace all the instances of <username>, <password> and <database> in the server.js file to login to Mongo DB.
Run node server.js for the backend.
Run npm start for the clientside.
